  <p>WE need to be notified when THIS happens …</p>

* Best Practice
* Default Enabled Alerts

  <p>When a consultant indicates that it is ‘best practice’ to be notified of an alert but doesn’t provide more context. This is similar to the WE need to be notified about THIS from the internal section before</p>
